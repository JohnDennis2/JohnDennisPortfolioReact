# John Dennis React Portfolio

## User Story

As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Description

Upon accessing the portfolio, visitors encounter a fully-functional page comprising a header, a content section, and a footer.
Within the header, the developer's name is prominently displayed alongside navigation links, each corresponding to distinct sections of the portfolio.
Navigation options encompass About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with the currently active section visibly highlighted.
Interacting with a navigation link seamlessly transitions users to the associated section below, sans page reloading, ensuring a consistent highlight on the selected title.
By default, the portfolio loads with the About Me section preselected, offering a recent photo or avatar of the developer along with a succinct biography.
The Portfolio section showcases labeled images of five applications developed by the individual, accompanied by direct links to both the deployed applications and their respective GitHub repositories.
Within the Contact section, a user-friendly form awaits, requesting essential details including name, email address, and message.
Failure to input text into a form field triggers a notification prompting users to complete the mandatory field before proceeding.
Inputting an invalid email address into the designated field generates an error notification, ensuring data accuracy.
The Resume section furnishes a convenient link for downloading the developer's resume, supplemented by a comprehensive list detailing their proficiencies.
