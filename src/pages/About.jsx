      My name is John Dennis and my journey began over a decade ago in the vibrant world of film and television, where I immersed myself in every facet of production, drawing upon my degree in Communications with a focus in film and television from UNT. Throughout the years, I've traversed various departments with fervor, from camera and electric to audio, production, and post-production. This diverse background has not only honed my leadership, adaptability, and project management skills but also fostered a profound understanding of storytelling and visual communication. As a Director and Producer, I've spearheaded multiple projects ranging from commercial to corporate and short films, contributing extensively to every stage of production - from writing scripts and storyboards to auditioning actors and managing budgets. Notably, my roles in Production, Camera and Electric, and Post Production have allowed me to wear multiple hats, including serving as an Associate Producer on a reality series pilot, handling grip and electric duties on major high-budget productions, and assuming the responsibilities of a camera operator and assistant. Moreover, my experience as an Editor for Chili's restaurants in-house training and commercials, along with serving as DP for all my projects, has provided me with a robust skill set in video editing and production. Now, as I near the completion of the UT boot camp, I've transitioned my focus to coding and software development, acquiring expertise in cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, React, Handlebars.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Sequelize ORM, MVC architecture, jQuery, RESTful APIs, authentication mechanisms, and deployment using Heroku, among others. This fusion of technical prowess and creative storytelling acumen positions me as a uniquely versatile professional, poised to deliver innovation and excellence across diverse projects in the ever-evolving technology and media landscape.
